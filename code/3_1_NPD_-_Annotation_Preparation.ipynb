The Athencum is commonly regarded only as a literary review , a mere vehicle for criticism on the works of others ; but it ought to take a much higher rank in public estimation , for its original papers are numerous , and characterised by a philanthropic spirit . The criticism of the Athenceum is never severe for the sake of severity ; but at the same time it never permits a semblance of talent or bienveillance to pass for the reality . The reviews properly so called , of this hebdomadal , have an advantage over those of the Quarterlies , however analogous the latter may be in strength and acumen , in being wholly free from political bias , a very nightmare on the energies of criticism , as those must feel who sit at the feet of Longinus or Quintilian to censure or praise , as the cap fits , Whig or Tory . Initsscrutiny of worksin painting or sculpture , the Athenceum realises all that the purest taste could hope for or desire . It goes at once au fond ; and its deductions are given with admirable lucidity . Its musical and theatrical eritiques are ably written . Published by JohnC .
